# Wintery website for Hackclub's YSWS Winter Boba Drops 

This is a website for Hackclub's YSWS Winter Boba Drops. It is a static site built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It has a calendar-like layout and gives you a task related to the holidays to do each day! (Tasks generated, because I'm not creative enough to come up with 32 tasks on my own.). Each task is locked until the day it is supposed to be done on. Hackers can find what those easily, obviously (psst- are you one?).
